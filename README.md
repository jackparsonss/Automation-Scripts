# Automation-Scripts

This is my repository where I put all my command line utility/automation scripts

## Scripts
###### mydb.py:
- This script acts as a mini db where I can store key value pairs of whatever is currently on my clipboard with a key word

###### toList.py:
- This scripts takes a bunch of text that is copied to my cliboard and pastes new text to my cliboard as a markdown list

###### passgen.py
- Creates a strong random password and copies it on to the clipboard

###### mapit.py
- Takes an address either from the command line or clipboard and opens a browser at the address

###### google.py
- Googles everything that is given as command line arguments

###### getdocxtext.py
- Takes a .docx file and copies all the text to your clipboard

###### GetMediumArticles.py
- When this command is run it generates the top articles of given medium.com publications and writes them to my daily note in my obsidian note taking vault for me to look at every morning

###### Morning.py
- Takes advantage of GetMediumArticles.py to open all apps I use in the morning and finishes by opening up my obsidian daily vault to a new daily note where it then gets filled with medium article links

###### toObsidian.py
- Takes all the files in my downloads folder and moves them into the resources folder in my obsidian vault
