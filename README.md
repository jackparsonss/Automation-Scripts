# Automation-Scripts

This is my repository where I put all my command line utility/automation scripts

## Scripts
###### mydb.py:
- This script acts as a mini db where I can store key value pairs of whatever is currently on my clipboard with a key word

###### toList.py:
- This scripts takes a bunch of text that is copied to my cliboard and pastes new text to my cliboard as a markdown list

###### passgen.py
- Creates a strong random password and copies it on to the clipboard

###### mapit.py
- Takes an address either from the command line or clipboard and opens a browser at the address

###### google.py
- Googles everything that is given as command line arguments
